# saudi-arabia-rainfall
Synthetic rainfall forecasting model for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

This project is a personal and independent effort to re-create and improve upon a proprietary Fortran model. The goal is to gain experience with Python programming and its associated data analysis libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, etc). 

The synthetic rainfall forecaster uses 30-years of historical rainfall data as input. Because the raw rainfall data is proprietary, it will not be posted.
